### How it Works

#### Socket Communication

This application leverages Socket.IO to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. The client connects to the server through a socket.
2. Once connected, both the client and server can emit and listen to specific events.
3. This allows for instant message transmission and reception, enabling real-time communication between users.
